# Practical Guides

**Theory meets practice—actionable patterns for real automation challenges.**

While the other Deep Dive sections explore **fundamentals** and **architecture**, this section provides **practical, battle-tested guides** for common automation scenarios. These aren't academic exercises—they're patterns refined through production use.

## The Purpose of Guides

You've learned:
- **[Fundamentals](../fundamentals/cdp.md)** - CDP, async, types
- **[Architecture](../architecture/browser-domain.md)** - Internal design patterns
- **[Network](../network/index.md)** - Protocols and proxies
- **[Fingerprinting](../fingerprinting/index.md)** - Detection and evasion

Now what? **How do you apply this knowledge to real problems?**

That's what guides are for: **bridging theory and practice**.

!!! quote "Practical Wisdom"
    **"In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not."** - Yogi Berra
    
    Guides distill complex technical knowledge into **actionable patterns** you can use immediately. They show you **what works** in production, not just what's theoretically possible.

## Current Guides

### CSS Selectors vs XPath
**[→ Read Selectors Guide](./selectors-guide.md)**

**The eternal debate—solved with data and best practices.**

Choosing between CSS selectors and XPath isn't about preference—it's about understanding **tradeoffs**, **performance characteristics**, and **maintainability**.

**What you'll learn**:

- **Syntax comparison** - Side-by-side examples for common patterns
- **Performance benchmarks** - Real measurements, not myths
- **Power vs simplicity** - When CSS isn't enough (text matching, axes)
- **Browser support** - Compatibility and edge cases
- **Best practices** - When to use each, anti-patterns to avoid
- **Complex examples** - Real-world selector challenges solved

**Why this matters**: Element location is the **foundation** of automation. Choose the wrong tool, and you'll fight your selectors forever. Choose wisely, and automation becomes straightforward.

## Coming Soon

### Concurrent Automation Patterns
**Coming in future releases**

**True parallelism—avoiding the async footguns.**

Learn how to automate multiple tabs, browsers, or workflows concurrently without race conditions, resource contention, or state corruption.

**Will cover**:

- `asyncio.gather()` for parallel operations
- `asyncio.create_task()` for fire-and-forget
- Semaphores for rate limiting
- Task groups and structured concurrency
- Error handling in concurrent code
- Shared state management

---

### Error Handling Strategies
**Coming in future releases**

**Robust automation—handling the inevitable failures.**

Real automation encounters timeouts, network errors, element state changes, and unexpected page behavior. Learn systematic error handling.

**Will cover**:

- Exception hierarchy and when to catch what
- Retry strategies with exponential backoff
- Timeout configuration at multiple levels
- Graceful degradation patterns
- Logging and debugging production errors
- Circuit breaker pattern for flaky systems

---

### Performance Optimization
**Coming in future releases**

**Fast automation—from seconds to milliseconds.**

Learn systematic approaches to identifying and eliminating performance bottlenecks in automation code.

**Will cover**:

- Profiling async Python (cProfile limitations)
- Network latency analysis and mitigation
- DOM operation batching
- Parallel vs sequential operations
- Caching strategies (element references, selectors)
- Connection pooling and reuse

---

### Stealth Automation Checklist
**Coming in future releases**

**Anti-detection—practical checklist for undetectable automation.**

Synthesizing fingerprinting knowledge into an actionable checklist you can follow step-by-step.

**Will cover**:

- Configuration checklist (browser options, preferences)
- Consistency verification (network vs browser)
- Behavioral mimicry patterns
- Testing your fingerprint
- Common mistakes that trigger detection
- Progressive enhancement (good → better → undetectable)

---

### Data Extraction Patterns
**Coming in future releases**

**Efficient scraping—from HTML chaos to structured data.**

Modern web pages are complex. Learn patterns for extracting data reliably despite dynamic rendering, infinite scroll, lazy loading, and obfuscation.

**Will cover**:

- Waiting strategies (element presence, network idle, custom conditions)
- Pagination patterns (next button, infinite scroll, load more)
- Table extraction (simple tables, nested tables, dynamic columns)
- JSON-LD and structured data
- Screenshot-based extraction (OCR when necessary)
- Validation and data quality checks

---

### Form Automation Patterns
**Coming in future releases**

**Complex forms—handling dropdowns, file uploads, multi-step flows.**

Forms are deceptively complex: validation, dependencies, AJAX submission, custom controls. Master the patterns.

**Will cover**:

- Input types (text, select, radio, checkbox, file)
- Custom controls (React Select, Date pickers)
- Multi-step forms with validation
- File uploads (direct input, drag-and-drop, file chooser)
- Dynamic fields (conditional visibility, validation dependencies)
- Error handling and retry strategies

## Guide Philosophy

Guides follow consistent principles:

### 1. Production-Ready Code
All examples are **complete and tested**—not pseudocode or simplified demonstrations. You can copy-paste and adapt to your needs.

### 2. Real-World Scenarios
Guides address **actual problems** encountered in production automation, not contrived examples.

### 3. Tradeoff Analysis
When multiple approaches exist, guides **compare** them objectively with pros/cons, not just "here's one way."

### 4. Progressive Complexity
Start simple, add complexity incrementally. Basic pattern first, then edge cases and advanced variations.

### 5. Anti-Patterns Highlighted
Show **what NOT to do** explicitly—common mistakes caught through code review or production debugging.

## How to Use Guides

Guides are **reference material**, not sequential tutorials:

✅ **Skim** for patterns relevant to your current problem  
✅ **Bookmark** guides you'll need repeatedly  
✅ **Adapt** examples to your specific context  
✅ **Combine** patterns from multiple guides  

Don't read sequentially cover-to-cover  
Don't blindly copy without understanding tradeoffs  
Don't use outdated patterns (check publication date)  

## Contributing Guides

Have a pattern worth sharing? Guides are **community-driven**:

**What makes a good guide**:

- Solves a **real problem** encountered in production
- Provides **working code**, not just concepts
- Compares **multiple approaches** with tradeoffs
- Highlights **common mistakes** explicitly
- Explains **why**, not just **how**

See [Contributing](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for submission guidelines.

## Guides vs Features Documentation

**Confused about the difference?**

|| Features Documentation | Deep Dive Guides |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Teach what Pydoll can do | Show how to solve problems |
| **Scope** | Single method/feature | Multiple features combined |
| **Depth** | API reference + examples | Patterns + tradeoffs + best practices |
| **Order** | Structured by component | Structured by problem |
| **Examples** | Simple, isolated | Complex, production-ready |

**Use Features for**: Learning Pydoll's API  
**Use Guides for**: Solving real automation challenges

## Beyond Guides

After mastering practical patterns:

- **[Architecture](../architecture/browser-domain.md)** - Understand why patterns work
- **[Network](../network/index.md)** - Network-level optimization
- **[Fingerprinting](../fingerprinting/evasion-techniques.md)** - Anti-detection techniques

Guides provide **immediate value**. Architecture provides **deep understanding**. Both make you effective.
